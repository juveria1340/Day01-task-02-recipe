                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p> 1/2 cup maida<br>
                    1/3 cup rice flour <br>
                    1/2 cup rava / sooji /semolina <br>
                    1 medium sized onion <br>
                    1 - 2 green chili <br>
                    1/4 tsp finely chopped ginger <br>
                    1 tbsp chopped curry leaves <br>
                    1/4 cup roasted and crushed peanuts (or 2 tbsp cashew) <br>
                    1 tsp sesame seeds  <br>
                    1 tsp poppy seeds <br>
                    1 tsp ghee <br>
                    2 tbsp hot oil <br>
                    1 tsp salt or as per your taste <br>
                    oil to deep fry</p>

                    <h2>Method</h2>
            
            <p>
                1. Firstly in a bowl take ½ cup of rice flour.<br>

                2. Then add ¼ cup fine rava (suji or cream of wheat) and ¼ cup all purpose flour.<br>

                3. Next add ½ cup finely chopped onion, 1 to 2 finely chopped green chilies,
                   8 to 9 chopped curry leaves and 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves.<br>

                4. Add salt as per taste and 1 pinch hing (asafoetida). Adding asafoetida is optional and can be skipped.<br>

                5. Mix very well and keep aside.<br>

                6. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl or steel measuring cup. The oil has to become hot. You can also use 1 tablespoon ghee instead of oil.<br>

                7. Add the hot oil in the flours+onions+spices mixture.<br>

                8. With a spoon mix very well. Do not mix with hands as the oil will be hot.<br>

                9. Then add 4 to 4.5 tablespoons water in parts.<br>

                10. Add water in parts and begin to mix and form a dough. I added 4.5 tablespoons of water.<br>
                    The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of sooji (rava), flours and the<br> 
                    moisture in the onions. So add accordingly and in parts. You should get a nice soft dough like a chapati dough. It should not be dry or sticky.<br>

                11. Mix to a soft smooth dough like a chapati dough. If the dough feels sticky, then add some 2 to 4 teaspoons all purpose flour and mix again.<br>
                    If the dough looks dry, then sprinkle some water and continue to mix.<br>

                12. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Take a small to medium portion of the dough and shape into a round ball or patty.<br>

                13. Add a small piece of the dough mixture in the hot oil. If it comes up gradually and steadily, the oil is ready to be fried. Fry them on medium flame.<br>

                14. Maddur vada is ready to eat.<br>
